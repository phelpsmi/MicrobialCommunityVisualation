\section{Introduction}
Our client, Dr. Jenna Lang, a microbiology researcher from University of California Davis requested that we create a tool that she could use to visualize microbial population data as human faces. This tool could potentially help microbiology researchers (as well as those from other fields) find patterns that aren't obvious using existing visualization techniques. 

Currently, the standard visualizations are pie charts or heat maps. Unfortunately, Pie charts aren't effective when there are a large number of categories to represent because there are too many slices. Heat maps on the other hand, while still useful to see patterns, do not make proportions between organisms obvious the way pie charts do. Our tool takes advantage of the human brain's ability to recognize and interpret patterns in faces to visualize data, so users can find new patterns that they would normally miss.

Our team consisted of Thomas Albertine and Michael Phelps. We had no formal roles aside from ``developer'', although generally (but not exclusively) Thomas worked on the backend code, loading data files and generating models, while Michael worked on the frontend code, connecting the backend to a user interface (henceforth referred to as UI). Our client played a hands off role. We spoke with her early in the project to collect requirements and have contacted her to revisit requirements or to keep her aprised of how the project is going, but she generally gave usa lot of freedom regarding how to proceed.
