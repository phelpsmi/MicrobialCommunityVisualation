Subject 1
Biology Student
Comments:
 Regarding task 5, subject says that blue and green are not intuitive colors to represent whether something is selected or not.
 
 Regarding task 6, subject got distracted by model parameter options, which delayed her completion time.
 
 Subject found model feature names confusing and unhelpful for determining what the result of the model will be.
 
Subject 2
Student who's first language is not English
Comments:
 Discovered bug in analysis view that not all selected widgets are sent to analysis view when the button is clicked. This bug has since been fixed.
 
 Subject states that the model features list is very detailed, which is good.
 
 Doesn't like that each face doesn't have a corresponding sample name.
 
Subject 3
Computer Science Student
Comments:
 Subject was confused as to how the faces corresponded to the data that we were representing.
 
 Subject states that the output is self explanatory if the user knows what the tool is supposed to do in advance.
 
Subject 4
Sleep Deprived Student
Comments:
 Regarding task 1, the subject had difficulty using basic Windows functionality, but this difficulty decreased as the test progressed.
 
 Regarding task 2, subject said that the tool was "Very thorough".
 
 Regarding task 3, the subject exceeded the maximum time limit without showing progress. Subject was unable to find the ratio radio button.
 
 Regarding task 4, the subject suggests that we include a loading bar, or some way to show the user that the tool is working. I suspect closing the window to reveal the python console would work as well.
 
 After test completion, subject states that it was difficult, and would like to try again for a better completion time.
 
 Subject states that feature names were not intuitively connected to model parameters.
 
Subject 5
Fish and Wildlife Student
Comments:
 Regarding task 7, subject mentioned that not all model features are visible from the thumbnail view. He suggests making the models rotate so that all sides and angles are visible.
